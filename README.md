# Benchmark Playground

Welcome to the Benchmark Playground! This repository provides a platform for benchmarking various algorithms, data structures, and code optimizations on different environments to find the best use-case for a problem.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to facilitate:

- **Benchmarking Algorithms:** Explore and compare the performance of different algorithms in various scenarios.
- **Testing Data Structures:** Evaluate and measure the efficiency of different data structures under different use cases.
- **Code Optimization Experimentation:** Experiment with code optimizations and assess their impact on performance.
